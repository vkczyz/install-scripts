# Linux Installation Scripts

~~This script installs Arch Linux and configures the environment according to my preferences. It was made for personal use but you're free to use it if you'd like.~~

~~Just run `install` to begin.~~

This script was never fully completed and, with the introduction of an official installer, there's no real reason to use it anymore. Run it at your own risk.
